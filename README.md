# Workflow-Demo

Workflow is a task list with built-in resource management. Utilizing commonly-accessible storage, such as Dropbox or a removable local drive, it streamlines work across multiple systems by providing a central access point to your projects and the resources - files, web pages, notes, etc - relevant to those projects.

This is a demo build, and this project wasn't originally intended for anything but personal use before school/work mothballed it a couple years ago, so naturally it's unfinished, and what is finished is the stuff that was most immediately useful to me at the time: Dropbox support is implemented, and basic library creation, task creation, and resource attachment should work properly.
